# Lovable Incompetent Character

Create endearing characters whose earnest efforts exceed their abilities, making failure relatable and learning visible through the gap between confidence and competence.

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create characters whose incompetence stems from laziness or malice
- Mock actual people with genuine limitations
- Make incompetence an excuse for harmful behavior
- Create characters without redeeming human qualities

**Integrity Requirements:**
1. Incompetence must be paired with genuine effort
2. Character's struggles must be relatable, not pitiable
3. Failures reveal universal human truths
4. Audience roots for character despite (because of) their failings

## When to Use

- Need to model learning processes or demonstrate growth
- Content about mistakes, failures, or development
- Making expertise less intimidating by showing the struggling learner
- Teaching through character who's figuring it out alongside audience
- Demonstrating that trying earnestly matters more than succeeding immediately
- Showing the gap between knowledge and application

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| domain | Yes | Area where character is incompetent |
| core_need | Yes | What character genuinely wants/needs |
| one_competence | No | Something character IS good at (provides contrast) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Establish Core Competence Island

Give them ONE thing they do well:

**Why This Matters:**
- Pure incompetence = pathetic
- Competence in one area + incompetence in what matters = lovable

**The Rule:** They CAN do something. Just not the thing they NEED to do.

**Template:**
"[Character] is brilliant at [competence area] but utterly hopeless at [area that actually matters to their happiness]."

### Step 2: Define the Incompetence Gap

Create specific, believable incompetence:

**What They Think They Can Do:**
- Overconfident assessment of ability
- Genuine belief they're succeeding
- Blind spots about obvious failures

**What They Actually Do:**
- Consistent patterns of failure
- Same mistakes repeatedly
- Inability to learn from consequences

**Why They Can't See the Gap:**
- Defense mechanism (too painful to acknowledge)
- Lack of feedback (people accommodate them)
- Never had to be competent in this area before

### Step 3: Root in Genuine Need

The incompetence must block something they truly want:

**Surface Want** (what they say they want):
The obvious, stated goal

**Deep Need** (what they actually need):
The underlying emotional requirement

**The Tension:**
Their incompetence prevents the deep need while they chase the surface want.

### Step 4: Make Them Try Earnestly

Effort + failure = sympathy; laziness + failure = contempt.

**Earnest Effort Indicators:**
- They genuinely believe in their approach
- They work hard at it (even if misdirected)
- They want to be better
- Visible disappointment when they fail
- Continued hope despite repeated failures

### Step 5: Create the Lovability Recipe

**Lovability Formula:**
- Awareness Without Growth: Moments of clarity followed by return to delusion
- Vulnerability Displayed: Let them be hurt publicly
- No Malice: They don't mean to hurt others
- Childlike Quality: Innocent despite experience
- Self-Deprecating Awareness: Jokes about own failures while continuing them

## Output Format

```markdown
## Character Profile: [Character Name]

### Core Competence Island
**What they're good at:** [one area of actual competence]
**The contrast:** [how this makes their incompetence more striking]

### The Incompetence Gap
**Domain of incompetence:** [specific area where they fail]
**What they think:** [overconfident beliefs]
**What's actually true:** [contradicting reality]
**Why they can't see it:** [defense mechanism or blind spot]

### Need Structure
**Surface want:** [what they say they want]
**Deep need:** [what would actually fulfill them]
**How incompetence blocks both:** [the mechanism]

### Lovability Components
**Vulnerability:** [how they're emotionally exposed]
**Innocence:** [childlike quality despite experience]
**No malice:** [proof they don't mean harm]

### Character in Action
**Typical failure pattern:**
1. [confident approach]
2. [earnest execution of flawed plan]
3. [inevitable failure]
4. [moment of awareness]
5. [quick recovery to delusion]

**Audience response:** [why we root for them]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Character becomes too pathetic | Add more competence; increase effort level |
| Character seems lazy | Show more genuine trying; add real disappointment |
| Audience loses sympathy | Increase vulnerability; reduce harm to others |
| Incompetence feels forced | Root it in believable psychology |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Character has one clear area of genuine competence
- [ ] Incompetence is specific, consistent, and believable
- [ ] Character's need is genuine and relatable
- [ ] Efforts are earnest, visible, and continuous
- [ ] Audience roots for character despite knowing they'll fail
- [ ] Failures teach without making character pathetic
